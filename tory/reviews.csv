2022-10-10,Inglourious Basterds,2009,https://boxd.it/3jggqB,2.5,Yes,"the first half has all of the long drawn out wanky scenes typical of a Quentin movie, interspaced with fun short scenes.  the second? fast-paced action and tension that is darkly funny and mildly rewarding.

all favour gained with the bastards was lost as the only 2 female characters are killed. I don't care because they're women, this is a movie where almost everyone dies, and you're meant to feel sad, that some of the good guys lost. Quentin typically has a good grasp on character motivation, but then has Shoshana die because she felt sympathy? for the man who was seconds away from assaulting her.  The actress dies in a brutal and lingering shot of her being strangled, the most drawn-out death of the movie.

Why was it as brutal and long as it was? at a point where the audience already understands the evil of the nazi, and knew her fate the second he started talking to the group in the lobby... it was unnecessary, aside from the fetishization of women's pain. 

If Quentin simply didn't bother to write women, I feel this movie would have been better off",femme attic,2022-10-07

anyway,, 

You ever think about the Greek myth of Pandora? 

The idea goes, to punish mankind for tricking him, Zeus has the whole pantheon help out to create Pandora, she of the gifts. Pandora is given beauty, grace and then Hermes is commanded  ""to put in her the mind of a bitch and the character of a thief. ""

and when he was finished creating her ""Amazement took hold of the immortal gods and mortals as they saw the sheer trick, from 
which human beings could not escape. For from her is the race of the female sex, the ruinous tribes of women, a great affliction, who live with mortal men"" 

or in Christian terms, do you ever think about Eve?

This movie kept reminding me of how and where men put the blame for the problems in life, encapsulated in Nellie's rise and fall and lack of a real character. The fact that she got more 2 dimensional the longer the film went on is quite incredible.

I'm a fan of good comedy, the first half? I guess? this film is a solid 4/4.5 for me.. lesbians are always a good thing to chuck in.  If you, I don't know, try to care about showing a lesbian romance on screen in your 3-HOUR LONG FILM?? Maybe take your jerk-off youtube compilation ""History Of Film in 5 Minutes!!"" out of the ending and care about your female characters more.

my thoughts are so messy with this film, and I'm so sick of seeing beautiful women through a male lens. I'm tired of a lack of sympathy,  I want more,  and every woman that gets affected by men perpetuating myths of how 'psycho' their ex is contributing to this false narrative taken in the form of a red pill.",,2023-04-27
